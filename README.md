# Mouse Tumor Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset of mouse tumor volumes under different drug regimens. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of these treatments and identify any significant trends or outliers in the data.

## Project Description
The project analyzes tumor volume data from mice treated with various drug regimens. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of these treatments and explore any correlations between different variables.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

Mouse ID
Drug Regimen
Sex
Age (months)
Weight (g)
Timepoint
Tumor Volume (mm3)
Metastatic Sites

## Observations and Inferences
1. Capomulin and Ramicane Effectiveness: Capomulin and Ramicane show significantly lower mean tumor volumes, indicating their potential effectiveness in reducing tumor size.
2. Variability in Ketapril and Naftisol: High variances in tumor volumes for Ketapril and Naftisol suggest inconsistent treatment responses.
3. Weight and Tumor Volume Correlation: A strong positive correlation (0.84) exists between mouse weight and tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors.

## Results
The results of the analysis include visualizations and statistical summaries that highlight the effectiveness of different drug regimens and any significant trends or outliers in
